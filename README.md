## Greetings!!

Sometimes in front end development especially using React Js we want to have a theme switcher in our website to look good. 
Often in some professional websites we see that the theme of the app is changed with a smooth transision when the button or switch is pressed.

Well this repository contains the code that performs the same at very basic level !!

Simply clone this repository and run `npm install` on the command line.

Then type `npm run dev` to start the local server and Voila!! The simple theme changer is up and running !! 

This can be very helpful if you want to build a super amazing frontend sites in React which includes toggling of themes!!
